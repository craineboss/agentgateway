## Basic Example

This example shows how to use the agentgateway to proxy A2A requests.

### Running the example

```bash
cargo run -- -f examples/a2a/config.json
```

Let's look at the config to understand what's going on. First off we have a listener, which tells the gateway how to listen for incoming requests/connections. In this case we're using the `a2a` listener, which is a simple HTTP listener that listens on port 3000.

```json
  "listeners": [
    {
      "name": "google-adk",
      "protocol": "A2A",
      "sse": {
        "address": "0.0.0.0",
        "port": 3000
      }
    }
  ],
```

In addition, we have a tracing section, which tells the gateway how to trace the incoming requests. In this case we're using the `otlp` tracer, which is a simple HTTP tracer that listens on port 4317.

```json
  "tracing": {
    "tracer": {
      "otlp": {
        "endpoint": "http://localhost:4317"
      }
    }
  },
```

Next we have a targets section, which tells the gateway how to proxy the incoming requests.
In this case, we are proxying to an agent we have named `google_adk`, listening on port 10002.
To run this yourself, follow the [sample documentation](https://github.com/google/A2A/tree/main/samples/python/agents/google_adk).

```json
  "targets": {
    "a2a": [
      {
        "name": "google_adk",
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": "10002"
      }
    ]
  }
```

To test this, we can run the sample [`a2a` CLI](https://github.com/google/A2A/tree/main/samples/python/hosts/cli)

```bash
uv run hosts/cli --agent http://localhost:3000/google-adk
```

From here, you can send requests through the CLI and view them being proxied.
